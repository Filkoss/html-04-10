        Czech
        professional ice hockey forward

    <p> He started his hockey career in his native Havířov. He took his first hockey steps at the Havířov ice stadium in
        September 1999, where his mother Marcela brought him when he was three years old.[2] Pastrňák started playing
        hockey in girls' figure skates, but even with them he mastered the necessary basics of skating. When he was six
        years old, his hockey skills were already at such a level that even as a preschooler he played matches for the
        1st, 2nd, and even the 3rd grade. Later, at the age of 15, he also played for the A team of the Havířov club.
